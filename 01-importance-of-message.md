:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions 

- What is the purpose of a chart?
- How does human perception influence how easily someone can read a chart?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- Explain the purpose of charts in communicating about data
- Identify strategies that enhance or detract from how well a chart communicates (may not need this one)
- List elements of human perception that influence how well a chart communicates
- Identify elements of chart design that work with and against human perception

## Introduction

This is a lesson created via The Carpentries Workbench. It is written in
[Pandoc-flavored Markdown](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.txt) for static files and
[R Markdown][r-markdown] for dynamic files that can render code into output. 
Please refer to the [Introduction to The Carpentries 
Workbench](https://carpentries.github.io/sandpaper-docs/) for full documentation.

What you need to know is that there are three sections required for a valid
Carpentries lesson:

 1. `questions` are displayed at the beginning of the episode to prime the
    learner for the content.
 2. `objectives` are the learning objectives for an episode displayed with
    the questions.
 3. `keypoints` are displayed at the end of the episode to reinforce the
    objectives.

Inline instructor notes can help inform instructors of timing challenges
associated with the lessons. They appear in the "Instructor View"

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge 

## Challenge 1: List elements of human perception that interact with charts and graphs

From the list below, choose the three elements of human perception that interact with charts and graphs

a. Object position
b. Linear properties
c. Spatial properties
d. Scent
e. Texture

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution 

## Answers
 
a, b, and c are the correct choices.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


## Challenge 2: how do you nest solutions within challenge blocks?

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution 

You can add a line with at least three colons and a `solution` tag.

## Figures

You can use standard markdown for static figures with the following syntax:

`![optional caption that appears below the figure](figure url){alt='alt text for
accessibility purposes'}`

## Math

One of our episodes contains $\LaTeX$ equations when describing how to create
dynamic reports with {knitr}, so we now use mathjax to describe this:

`$\alpha = \dfrac{1}{(1 - \beta)^2}$` becomes: $\alpha = \dfrac{1}{(1 - \beta)^2}$

Cool, right?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints 

- The purpose of a chart is to communicate something about data.
- Humans can quickly distinguish _ _ _ but have more difficult distinguishing _ _ _.
