- Identify what message would like to communicate about a dataset.
- Identify how to best communicate the message with appropriate visuals.
- Generate graphs based on your decisions using software.

## Introduction

This chapter will use the knowlege you have gained and apply it to generate graphs using software tools. What you should know:

1. There are a multitude of software tools that can help generate charts for you.
2. All software tools have the strengths and weaknesses. There is no best tool for all tasks or all users.
3. For this lessen we will be using google sheets. For our purposes this tool has some important advantages.
    1. The software is freely available online.
    2. The software works similarly regardless of the users operating system
    3. The software is interacted primarily through a graphical interface that can make it more intuitive to new users.

Other tools can have many advantages as well. Certain software which use a command line interface may have a steeper learning curve, but has other advantages such as improved. reproducibility.

# Importing your Data
We need to import our canid data into google sheets. Our data is currently stored as tab seperated values, otherwise known as a tsv file. This is a simple text file. Each line of the file represents a new line in a table. The values in each column of the table appear in sequence seperated by a tab character. Generally tsv tables have the limitation that you can't store any values in a table that also has a tab character. If you haven't already, go ahead and download the canid data now. 

[Your Data](data/canids.tsv)


:::: keypoints 

- Identify if you are communicating a comparison, distribution, composition, relationship.
- Use the chart chooser a good chart for your particular dataset.
- Choose the tool you will be using to generate your chart
- Import your data making sure your data is "clean" and "tidy".
