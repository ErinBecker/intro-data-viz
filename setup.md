## Introduction

This lesson introduces data visualization by focusing on the basic components of a chart and on the decisions you need to make in order to create and refine a chart. You will learn to craft messages about data and communicate those messages in charts. The principles applied to charts in this lesson can be applied to more complex data visualizations, but these are beyond the scope of this lesson.

## Data Set

In this lesson we will use a dataset about large North American canids: wolves, coyotes, and foxes[^1]. Public policy and scientific decisions have drastically changed these populations over the past century. The presence or absence of these animals near population centers, livestock, and nature preserves stirs public debate in the present day. You will practice communicating scientific information about large North American canids in messages and charts that the public can understand.

Download the [data](data/canids.tsv) and unzip it to your Desktop.

The data download link pulls the file `canids.tsv` from this lesson's [GitHub repository](https://gihub.com/carpentries-incubator/intro-data-viz). This file is a tab-separated values format of the original data set deposited at Dryad and is the format used in this lesson. An [Excel-formatted version of the data](https://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/24074) is also available in the [Dryad record](https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.s0d20).

## Software Setup

This lesson uses [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/) as the software tool for generating charts from tabular data. This tool has some important advantages:

- The software is freely available online.
- The software works similarly regardless of operating system.
- The software uses a graphical interface, which can be more approachable for new users.

For this lesson, you will need a free [Google account](https://accounts.google.com) to use Google Sheets and save your work. You will also need an up-to-date web browser.

[Episode 4: Communicating the Message](episodes/03-communicating-the-message) contains all of the Google Sheets content in this lesson. The charts functions in Google Sheets are similar to those in other spreadsheet programs such as Microsoft Excel or LibreOffice Calc. You are free to adapt Episode 4 if you wish to use a different spreadsheet program.
