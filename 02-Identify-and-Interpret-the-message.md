:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions 

1. What are four common messages usually communicated in a chart?
2. What are useful charts to communicate these messages?
3. How do we construct text to describe these messages?
4. How does the type of data help determine the message?
5.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

After completing this episode you will be able to:

- identify data types as discrete, continuous, or categorical
- interpret and describe the message in four common chart types
- illustrate the message of four common chart types 
- use a flow diagram choose a chart type to communicate your message

## Introduction

Charts communicate a message about data that is dependent on the type of data.  (paragraph on data types)

To discuss these data types and later decide what charts to make and how to make them (Episode 3) we are going use a long-term dataset collected on the canids of North America.  The data are presented in Newsome and Ripple 2015 ![A continental scale trophic cascade from wolves through coyotes to foxes](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2656.12258).  (Give a brief summary of the paper and the data)

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge 

## Challenge 1

Choose the answer that most closely reflects your opinion.
Data visualization is for ____.

a) scientists
b) everyone
c) formal reports
d) economists

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution 

## Output
 
`b) everyone!`

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


## Challenge 2: Pair the data type names with the examples    

| Data Types  |   Example of data |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 1. discert   |  a. 1,2,3,...1000 |
| 2. continuous  |  b. 0,1 |
| 3. catagorical  |  c. dog, cat, turtle |

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution 

1. -> b
2. -> a
3. -> c

## Data Types  


## Four Common Chart Types

Comparison
Composition
Distribution
Relationships

## Identify the message  


## Describe the message  

## Illustrate the message  

## Use a flow chart to choose a chart for your message  




## Figures

You can use standard markdown for static figures with the following syntax:

`![Example figs](https://excalidraw.com/#json=M5p-guinhbiUarNN8Y_fK,GZXhOkPA4qLCIgbEx9i12A)

`![optional caption that appears below the figure](figure url){alt='alt text for
accessibility purposes'}`

![Figure ? Pie chart of the abundance of caninids are fox or coyote](fig/compositionPlot.png){indicate the percentages}


![You belong in The Carpentries!](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/carpentries/logo/master/Badge_Carpentries.svg){alt='Blue Carpentries hex person logo with no text.'}

## Math

One of our episodes contains $\LaTeX$ equations when describing how to create
dynamic reports with {knitr}, so we now use mathjax to describe this:

`$\alpha = \dfrac{1}{(1 - \beta)^2}$` becomes: $\alpha = \dfrac{1}{(1 - \beta)^2}$

Cool, right?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints 

- Charts convey messages with interchangeable nouns and verbs
- Chart types ..
- Practice with linking chart types with charts is a valuable skill
