## Graphical elements and visual properties

When we create a chart, we can choose many different ways to represent the message we wish to convey. But in two or three dimensions, there are only a few graphical elements we have to work with[^1]:

- Point
- Line
- Area
- Volume

The data and data relationships we are representing in a chart have different quantities and categories. We can communicate these quantities and categories by adjusting a graphical element's visual properties[^2]:

 - Position
 - Alignment on one or more scales
 - Length
 - Direction
 - Angle
 - Size (amount of Area or Volume)
 - Curvature
 - Shading
 - Color

## Support your chart's message

The ten visual properties we just examined create many possible variations for the four fundamental graphical elements: point, line, area, and volume. With so many available options for visualizing information on a chart, it is important to remember the purpose of a chart: to communicate a message about patterns or relationships present in the data. Depicting information visually is as much art as science, but some research-backed guidelines can help us design a chart that supports our message rather than one that detracts or distracts from our message.

### Research on charts

Debates about chart format have taken place in the scientific literature since at least the 1920s[^2]. In 1984, Cleveland & McGill published a theory of "elementary perceptual tasks" that attempted to define the individual components of data representation and determine by experiment which components led to more accurate judgments about the underlying data. Despite their study's limitations, the guidelines they produced remain useful and inform modern guidance about designing charts[^4].

### Hierarchy of visual representations

The data behind your chart influences which of the four graphical elements you will use in your chart:

- Point: represent and compare exact values and distributions
- Line: represent and compare quantities, trends over time, parts of a whole, distributions
- Area: represent and compare quantities, trends over time, parts of a whole, distributions
- Volume: represent and compare quantities, trends over time, parts of a whole, distributions

Some treatments of these elements result in more accurate judgments about the underlying data than others. These are organized below by graphical element (this doesn't really work - revise tomorrow.)

Cleveland & McGill's order:
1. Position on common scale
2. Position on non-aligned scales
3. Length, direction, angle
4. Area
5. Volume, curvature
6. Shading, color saturation

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- There are four graphical elements that can represent data on a chart. The appearance of these elements can be modified with any of ten possible visual properties.
- Research suggests that many people can evaluate some of these visual representations more quickly and with more accuracy than others[^2]
- Visual representations that are easier to perceive accurately support a chart's message
- Visual representations that are more difficult to perceive accurately detract from a chart's message
