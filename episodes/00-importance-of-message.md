## Introduction

This lesson introduces data visualization by focusing on the basic components of a chart and on the decisions you need to make in order to create and refine a chart. You will learn to craft messages about data and communicate those messages in charts. The principles applied to charts in this lesson can be applied to more complex data visualizations, but these are beyond the scope of this lesson.

## The Purpose of a Chart

The purpose of a chart is to communicate. No "best" and "worst", but "better" and "worse". A better chart clearly communicates a message to the viewer. A worse chart  has no clear message and confuses the viewer.

## Ingredients of a Chart

The ingredients that influence how and what a chart communicates are:

- The underlying data
- A message about the data
- Design elements of the chart

An imbalance in any of these ingredients will make a chart impossible or ineffective:

- Without data, a chart has no information to communicate
- Without a message, a chart has nothing clear to say about the data
- Without design elements, a chart cannot convey information to the viewer

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge

## Challenge 1: Chart ingredients

From the list below, choose the three ingredients of a chart that create communication:

a. `x` and `y` axes
b. Underlying data
c. Message about the data
d. Software used to make the chart
e. Design elements of the chart

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution

## Answers

The correct choices are b, c, and e.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution

## Explanation:

- Choice a: `x` and `y` axes are individual design elements of the chart (e); by themselves, they are insufficient for creating communication.
- Choice d: The software used to create a chart is a tool for collecting and presenting the data, the message, and the design elements. Software can help or hinder chart creation, but software by itself does not create chart communication.

## Chart message

**TODO**: Text about where the chart's message comes from (Bertin 1981)

Insert figures into this section with the following syntax:

`![optional caption that appears below the figure](figure url){alt='alt text for
accessibility purposes'}`

![You belong in The Carpentries!](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/carpentries/logo/master/Badge_Carpentries.svg){alt='Blue Carpentries hex person logo with no text.'}

## Challenge 2: Source of a chart's message

(as an alternative, image of a data table and image of a chart - which best reveals a pattern?)

Choose the chart below that shows a relationship between two pieces of data.

**TODO**: Add hand-drawn images of three sample charts:

1. chart with `x` axis only (average monthly temperature)
2. chart with `y` axis only (average monthly number of walks a dog gets)
3. chart with `x` and `y` axes (plot these two against each other)

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution

Chart 3 shows a relationship between average monthly temperature and average number of walks a dog gets.

## Importance of Chart Message

Clearly-imparted information - messages - about relationships within a set of data drive problem-solving and decision-making about the entities represented by the data. These solutions and decisions have real-world consequences.

In this lesson we will use a dataset about large North American canids: wolves, coyotes, and foxes[^1]. Public policy and scientific decisions have drastically changed these populations over the past century. The presence or absence of these animals near population centers, livestock, and nature preserves stirs public debate in the present day.

In this lesson you will learn to craft messages about data and communicate those messages in charts. You will practice communicating scientific information about large North American canids in messages and charts that the public can understand.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- The purpose of a chart is to communicate
- Three key chart ingredients create communication
- A chart's message comes from the interactions between data elements when they are plotted... / relationships revealed when data are plotted along *x* and *y* coordinates in a Cartesian plane
- A chart's message drives decision-making and problem-solving
