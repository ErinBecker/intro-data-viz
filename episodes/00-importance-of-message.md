- Explain the purpose of a chart
- List the communication ingredients of a chart
- Identify the origin of a chart's message
- Explain the importance of a chart's message

## The Purpose of a Chart

The purpose of a chart is to communicate. No "best" and "worst", but "better" and "worse". A better chart clearly communicates a message to the viewer. A worse chart  has no clear message and confuses the viewer.

## Ingredients of a Chart

**TODO** Decide if this information needs to be here in this explicit way - could be that the chart ingredients get referenced along the way and summarized at the end.

The ingredients that influence how and what a chart communicates are:

- The underlying data
- A message about the data
- Design elements of the chart

An imbalance in any of these ingredients will make a chart impossible or ineffective:

- Without data, a chart has no information to communicate
- Without a message, a chart has nothing clear to say about the data
- Without design elements, a chart cannot convey information to the viewer

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge

## Challenge 1: Chart ingredients

From the list below, choose the three ingredients of a chart that create communication:

a. `x` and `y` axes
b. Underlying data
c. Message about the data
d. Software used to make the chart
e. Design elements of the chart

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution

## Answers

The correct choices are b, c, and e.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution

## Explanation:

Choice a: `x` and `y` axes are individual design elements of the chart (e); by themselves, they are insufficient for creating communication.

Choice d: The software used to create a chart is a tool for collecting and presenting the data, the message, and the design elements. Software can help or hinder chart creation, but software by itself does not create chart communication.

## What is a chart?

A chart is a visual representation of the relationships among data elements that have been recorded in a table. A visual representation allows people to SEE (immediately comprehend) relationships among data elements by processing them in the brain's visual cortex (citation?) rather than reading relationships and processing them in the language center.[^1].

### The role of tables

A table is a necessary precursor to a chart, but is not a substitute for a chart. A table must be read to convey its information, and it is difficult and time-consuming to try to understand any patterns that might be present in the data. Consider this data table:

| Average Monthly Temperature | Daily Walks per Dog |
|:---:|:---:|
|30 |0 |
|35 |1 |
|45 |1 |
|55 |2 |
|65 |3 |
|78 |2 |
|80 |2 |
|88 |1 |
|70 |3 |
|60 |3 |
|45 |1 |
|35 |0 |

:::::::::::::::::::::::: discussion

Take 1 minute to read the table and discuss it with your neighbor. How easy or difficult is it to understand the data? What patterns can you detect?

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### From table to chart

To create a chart, data elements recorded in a table are arranged along the `x` and `y` axes of a Cartesian plane.

Need a figure here to illustrate x, y, and their intersections (the relationships) - maybe this is the activity? A blank chart and a data table?

**TODO**: Insert the chart for the table above

Insert figures into this section with the following syntax:

`![optional caption that appears below the figure](figure url){alt='alt text for
accessibility purposes'}`

## Chart message

The relationship between the two elements that emerges when `x` is plotted against `y` creates the message of the chart.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge

## Challenge 2: Source of a chart's message

(as an alternative, image of a data table and image of a chart - which best reveals a pattern?)

Choose the sentence that best describes the relationship depicted in the chart above:

a. Dogs get fewer daily walks during seasonal temperature extremes.
b. Monthly average temperature varies during the year.
c. Dogs get between 0 and 4 walks daily.

Choose the chart below that shows a relationship between two pieces of data.

**TODO**: Add hand-drawn images of three sample charts:

1. chart with `x` axis only (average monthly temperature)
2. chart with `y` axis only (average monthly number of walks a dog gets)
3. chart with `x` and `y` axes (plot these two against each other)

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution

## Answer

The correct answer is a. This sentence describes an interaction between seasonal temperature and number of daily walks.

## Importance of Chart Message

Clearly-imparted information - messages - about relationships within a set of data drive problem-solving and decision-making about the entities represented by the data. These solutions and decisions have real-world consequences.

In this lesson we will use a dataset about large North American canids: wolves, coyotes, and foxes[^2]. Public policy and scientific decisions have drastically changed these populations over the past century. The presence or absence of these animals near population centers, livestock, and nature preserves stirs public debate in the present day.

In this lesson you will learn to craft messages about data and communicate those messages in charts. You will practice communicating scientific information about large North American canids in messages and charts that the public can understand.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- The purpose of a chart is to communicate
- Three key chart ingredients create communication
- A chart's message comes from the interactions between data elements when they are plotted... / relationships revealed when data are plotted along *x* and *y* coordinates in a Cartesian plane
- A chart's message drives decision-making and problem-solving
