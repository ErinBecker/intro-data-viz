:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions

- When creating a chart, what graphical elements do I have to work with?
- How do these graphical elements translate into representations of data?
- How do graphical elements support or detract from a chart's message?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- List graphical elements available for chart design
- Describe how graphical elements represent data relationships
- Identify graphical elements that result in more accurate judgments about the patterns and relationships visualized by a chart

## Graphical elements

When we create a chart, we can choose many different ways to represent the message we wish to convey. But in two or three dimensions, there are only a few elements we have to work with[^1]:

- Point
- Line
- Area
- Volume

The data and data relationships we are representing in a chart have different quantities and values. We can communicate these quantities and values by adjusting the appearance of the four fundamental elements through[^2]:

 - Position
 - Alignment on one or more scales
 - Length
 - Direction
 - Angle
 - Size (amount of Area or Volume)
 - Curvature
 - Shading
 - Color

1. Position on a common scale
2. Position on non-aligned scales
3. Length
4. Direction
5. Angle
6. Size (Area)
7. Size (Volume)
8. Curvature
9. Shading
10. Color

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- Graphical elements of chart design represent data relationships through position, shape, size, shading, and color
  - *use this list to simplify the Cleveland & McGill 10 perceptual tasks below*
- Move details up into lesson material:
- The graphical elements available for chart design (Bertin, 1981) are:
  - point
  - line
  - area
  - volume
  - shading (percent black to white, or grayscale)
  - color
- These elements represent data relationships through design components:
  - position
  - scale alignment
  - length
  - direction
  - angle
  - size (area and volume)
  - curvature
  - shading
  - color saturation
- Research suggests that many people can evaluate some of these design components more quickly and with more accuracy than others (Cleveland & McGill, 1984)
- Design components that are easier to perceive accurately support a chart's message
- Design components that are more difficult to perceive accurately detract from a chart's message
